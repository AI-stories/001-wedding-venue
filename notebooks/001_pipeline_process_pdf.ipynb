Due to space limitations. We are not able to tent our garden. \\nCan we bring our own desserts? \\nYes, you can bring and enjoy any dessert company during your event. If a vendor is delivering or setting up at the venue, they must be insured. \\nCan we leave cake, desserts or drinks over n i g h t in y our refrigerator? \\nUnfortunately no. AB desserts must be brought or delivered day-of. Nothing can be left overnight. \\nCan we have a \\'Grand Exit\\' at the end of the we d d i n g ? \\nYes! For safety reasons, your guests can line up inside the clubhouse starting in the foyer. Nothing can be thrown (rice, petals, streamers) and no sparklers allowed. Glow sticks or ribbon wands are a fun option. \\nAre decorations allowed? \\nYes, but specific rules are in place to keep the venue in tip top shape and to preserve the historical integrity: \\n• \\nAll decor must be free-standing. Nothing can be fastened, hung, taped or stapled to the walls, draperies, stage curtains, plants, garden arbors, railings or floors. \\n• \\nAll decor must comply with San Diego Fire Ordinances: \\n• \\nCandles are allowed inside, but must be protected by a non-flammable container whose top extends at least one inch above the top of the flame. \\n• \\nNo candles are allowed on the floor. \\n• \\nOther types of open flames and fireworks, including sparklers, are not allowed. \\n• \\nNo confetti, birdseed, rice, paper streamers, bubbles, glitter, sand, silly string, small crystals or stones may be used at any time. \\n• \\nNo substance may be applied to the floor. \\n• \\nUse of rose petals (white only, as colored ones will stain the concrete) are permitted for a garden ceremony. \\n\\'What are our responsibilities for clean up? \\nThe caterer is responsible for cleaning all food and beverage related areas. You must make arrangements to remove your decorations, centerpieces and any other personal items. The Thursday Club staff cleans the facility after the event is over. We are not able to accept any early drop off or next day pick-ups. \\nWe want to secure our date, what is the next s t e p ? \\nTo secure your date, we require 50% of the rental fee and a $1000 security deposit. The full rental fee is due 90 days before the event. The security deposit is a refundable deposit to cover damages and honor the contract time. We accept cash, checks, and credit cards. \\nThe heart of The Thursday Club is inspiring women of all ages who share the gift of giving. \\nFor over 100 years our members have combined social activities with fundraisers and volunteer commitments to benefit civic and benevolent projects in Balboa Park and the San Diego community. \\nr The Thursday Club founded in 1921 when four young women formed a club that would combine social activities with worthwhile civic and benevolent projects. It wasn\\'t until 1927, when The Thursday Club was granted the deed to a large parcel of land on a choice spot in the Sunset Cliffs area of Point Loma, that they would realize their dream of having a clubhouse to call their own. Today, the clubhouse is renowned as a beautiful San Diego wedding and event venue with timeless Spanish architecture and expansive ocean views. The venue rental business supports The Thursday Club\\'s philanthropic efforts, along with the clubhouse preservation and improvements \\n1224 Santa B a r b a r a S t r e e t [ San Dj 1 e g so, CA 92107 ww w.TheTh ursdayCIub.org ',\n",
